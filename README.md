# ai-offline-evaluations

This repository is serves as the source code to accompany the contents of an ai offline evaluations book. The intended use is to practical and hands-on code snippets that are reference throughout the book. 


## Overview

Offline evaluations to measure the effect of your AI model. As you iterate on an AI model, use this book as a reference for the offline evaluation strategies you should implement to verify your changes are moving metrics in the right (positive) direction. 

## AI Model Evaluations

To illustrate how to evaluate a model using the offline evaluation metrics detailed in this book, we'll use the LLM lama. 
You can download the lama AI model from huggingface. Huggingface is a standarized interface. 

A common type of model you can find out of the box image classifers (animal detection).

## What's in this repository
You'll find notebooks for each chapter, with example code to compute the offline evaluation formulas. Each notebook references data that's available in the sourcedata folder.
