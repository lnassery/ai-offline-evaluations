## How to Run This Notebook

The good news **you don’t need to install anything on your computer.** All you need is a browser. 

### 1. Open Google Colab
- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
- Make sure you’re signed into a Google account (any Gmail/Google account works).

### 2. Get the Notebook into Colab
You have **two options**:

**Option A — Download and Upload**
1. Download this notebook file (`offlineevaluationanatomy.ipynb`) to your local.
2. In Colab, click **File → Upload Notebook**.
3. Select the downloaded file.

**Option B — Open Directly from GitHub** 
1. In Colab, click **File → Open Notebook → GitHub tab**.
2. Paste the GitHub repo URL (or the notebook file URL).
3. Select the notebook from the list.

### 3. Connect to a Runtime
- Click the **Connect** button in the top right of Colab.
- Colab will start a free runtime for you (takes a few seconds).

### 4. Run Each Cell
- Click on the first code cell and click the play button. 
- Continue running cells in order. The outputs will appear beneath each cell executed. 

### 5. Read & Experiment
- Each section of the notebook mirrors a concept from Chapter 2 of the book.
- Try tweaking the code (for example, change `test_ratio` from `0.2` to `0.3`) and re-run to see how it changes the output.

## Notes

- **No setup required.** You don’t need Python installed locally — Colab has everything ready to go.
- **Dependencies are pre-installed.** The notebook uses `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, which Colab already includes.
