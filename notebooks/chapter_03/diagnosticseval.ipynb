    "1. **Indie Movie Fans**: Users who prefer indie films experience the highest error rate (approximately 90-95%), meaning that nearly all recommendations they receive are movies they wouldn't choose to watch. This indicates a significant failure of our recommendation system to serve this audience segment effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Action Movie Fans**: Users who prefer action films have a much lower error rate (approximately 65-70%), suggesting our algorithm is much more effective at recommending relevant content to this group.\n",

While our system might perform adequately in aggregate, it's failing specific user segments.\n",

    "This diagnostic evaluation clearly demonstrates how subgroup analysis can uncover critical issues in recommendation systems. The stark difference between indie and action fan experiences would be hidden when looking only at overall metrics like average recall or precision. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've performed a comprehensive evaluation of a movie recommendation system through multiple key lenses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diagnostic Evaluation**: We identified potential biases in our recommendations:\n",
    "   - Age-Based Bias: Younger users receive significantly more blockbuster recommendations than older users\n",
    "   - Subscription-Based Bias: Premium subscribers receive more recommendations featuring diverse casts\n",
    "   - Genre Distribution: There are differences in genre diversity across age groups\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Evaluation**: We measured how well our system recommends content users would actually watch:\n",
    "   - Overall recall metrics show how successful our recommendations are at capturing user preferences\n",
    "   - Demographic analysis of recall reveals which user groups are better served by our algorithm\n",
    "   - Long-tail content analysis highlights the balance between mainstream and niche recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Rate Analysis**: We calculated error rates by user preference subgroups:\n",
    "   - Identified a significant disparity in error rates between different genre preference groups\n",
    "   - Discovered that indie movie fans receive substantially more irrelevant recommendations\n",
    "   - Highlighted how subgroup analysis reveals critical issues that aggregate metrics would miss\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined evaluations give us a more complete picture of our recommendation system's effectiveness and fairness. This approach helps identify both bias issues and performance gaps before deploying to real users, allowing us to create recommendation systems that serve all user groups equitably."
